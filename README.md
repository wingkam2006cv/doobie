**doobie** is a pure functional JDBC layer for Scala. It is not an ORM, nor is it a relational algebra; it just provides a principled way to construct programs (and higher-level libraries) that use JDBC. **doobie** introduces very few new abstractions; if you are familiar with basic `scalaz` typeclasses like `Functor` and `Monad` you should have no trouble here.

For common use cases **doobie** provides a minimal but expressive high-level API:

```scala
import doobie.imports._, scalaz.effect.IO

val xa = DriverManagerTransactor[IO](
  "org.postgresql.Driver", "jdbc:postgresql:world", "postgres", ""
)

case class Country(code: String, name: String, population: Long)

def find(n: String): ConnectionIO[Option[Country]] = 
  sql"select code, name, population from country where name = $n".query[Country].option

// And then

scala> find("France").transact(xa).unsafePerformIO
res0: Option[Country] = Some(Country(FRA,France,59225700))
```

**doobie** is a [Typelevel](http://typelevel.org/) project. This means we embrace pure, typeful, functional programming, and provide a safe and friendly environment for teaching, learning, and contributing as described in the Typelevel [Code of Conduct](http://typelevel.org/conduct.html).

## Quick Start

The current release is **0.2.3**, which works on Scala **2.10.5** and **2.11** with

- scalaz 7.1
- scalaz-stream 0.7.2a
- shapeless 2.2

You should expect minor breaking changes for at least the next few versions, although these will be documented and kept to a minimum. To use **doobie** you need to add the following to your `build.sbt`.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.tpolecat" %% "doobie-core" % "0.2.3"
```

If you are using Scala 2.10.5 you must also add the paradise compiler plugin.

```scala
addCompilerPlugin("org.scalamacros" % "paradise" % "2.0.1" cross CrossVersion.full)
```

It is likely that you will want one or more add-on libraries. **doobie** provides the following, which have the same version as `doobie-core` and are released together.

* `doobie-contrib-h2` for [H2](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html)-specific type mappings.
* `doobie-contrib-hikari` for [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP) connection pooling.
* `doobie-contrib-postgresql` for [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org)-specific type mappings.
* `doobie-contrib-specs2` for [specs2](http://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/) support for typechecking queries.

See the [**book of doobie**](http://tpolecat.github.io/doobie-0.2.3/00-index.html) for more information on these add-ons.
