## book of doobie

This project is a set of [tut](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut) documents that you can compile into final documentation by saying `tut` from the sbt prompt. The output can be found under `target/scala-N.NN/tut/`. 

For now the doc is copied into a parallel checkout of `tpolecat.github.io` via the hacked-up `ctut` command, and from there it gets pushed up to the internets where it gets the Jekyll treatment. The end result is nice but the process is a bit crufty.
