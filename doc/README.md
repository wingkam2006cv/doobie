## DoobieDoc

This project is a set of [tut](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut) documents that you can compile into final documentation by saying `tut` from the sbt prompt. The output can be found under `target/scala-N.NN/tut/`. 

This is where the Wiki comes from, ostensibly, once I get it all set up.
