package doobie

/**
 * High-level database API. The constructors here are defined
 * in terms of those in `doobie.free.connection` but differ in the following ways:
 *
 *  - Enumerated values represented by `Int` values in JDBC are mapped to one of the proper types
 *    defined in `doobie.enum`.
 *  - Nullable values are represented in terms of `Option`.
 *  - Java collection types are translated to immutable Scala equivalents.
 *  - Actions that compute lifetime-managed resources do not return the resource directly, but rather
 *    take a continuation in the resource's monad.
 *  - Actions that compute values of impure types (`CLOB`, `InputStream`, etc.) do not appear in this API.
 *    They are available in the low-level API but must be used with considerable caution.
 *  - Lifting actions, low-level type mapping actions, and resource management actions do not appear
 *    in this API.
