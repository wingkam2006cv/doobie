## Connecting to a Database

In this chapter we start from the beginning. First we write a program that connects to a database and returns a value, and then we run that program in the REPL. We also touch on composing small programs to construct larger ones.

### Our First Program

Before we can use **doobie** we need to import some symbols. We will use package imports here as a convenience; this will give us the most commonly-used symbols when working with the high-level API.

```scala mdoc:silent
import doobie._
import doobie.implicits._
```

Let's also bring in Cats.

```scala mdoc:silent
import cats._
import cats.effect._
import cats.implicits._
```

In the **doobie** high level API the most common types we will deal with have the form `ConnectionIO[A]`, specifying computations that take place in a context where a `java.sql.Connection` is available, ultimately producing a value of type `A`.

So let's start with a `ConnectionIO` program that simply returns a constant.

```scala mdoc
val program1 = 42.pure[ConnectionIO]
```

This is a perfectly respectable **doobie** program, but we can't run it as-is; we need a `Connection` first. There are several ways to do this, but here let's use a `Transactor`.

```scala mdoc:silent
import doobie.util.ExecutionContexts

// We need a ContextShift[IO] before we can construct a Transactor[IO]. The passed ExecutionContext
// is where nonblocking operations will be executed. For testing here we're using a synchronous EC.
implicit val cs = IO.contextShift(ExecutionContexts.synchronous)

// A transactor that gets connections from java.sql.DriverManager and executes blocking operations
// on an our synchronous EC. See the chapter on connection handling for more info.
val xa = Transactor.fromDriverManager[IO](
  "org.postgresql.Driver",     // driver classname
  "jdbc:postgresql:world",     // connect URL (driver-specific)
  "postgres",                  // user
  "",                          // password
  Blocker.liftExecutionContext(ExecutionContexts.synchronous) // just for testing
)
```

```scala mdoc:invisible
implicit val mdocColors: doobie.util.Colors = doobie.util.Colors.None
```

A `Transactor` is a data type that knows how to connect to a database, hand out connections, and clean them up; and with this knowledge it can transform `ConnectionIO ~> IO`, which gives us a program we can run. Specifically it gives us an `IO` that, when run, will connect to the database and execute single transaction.

We are using `cats.effect.IO` as our final effect type, but you can use any monad `M[_]` given `cats.effect.Async[M]`. See *Using Your Own Target Monad* at the end of this chapter for more details.

The `DriverManagerTransactor` simply delegates to the `java.sql.DriverManager` to allocate connections, which is fine for development but inefficient for production use. In a later chapter we discuss other approaches for connection management.

And here we go.

```scala mdoc
val io = program1.transact(xa)
io.unsafeRunSync()
```

Hooray! We have computed a constant. It's not very interesting because we never ask the database to perform any work, but it's a first step.

> Keep in mind that all the code in this book is pure *except* the calls to `IO.unsafeRunSync`, which is the "end of the world" operation that typically appears only at your application's entry points. In the REPL we use it to force a computation to "happen".

Right. Now let's try something more interesting.

### Our Second Program

Now let's use the `sql` string interpolator to construct a query that asks the *database* to compute a constant. We will cover this construction in great detail later on, but the meaning of `program2` is "run the query, interpret the resultset as a stream of `Int` values, and yield its one and only element."

```scala mdoc
val program2 = sql"select 42".query[Int].unique
val io2 = program2.transact(xa)
io2.unsafeRunSync()
```

Ok! We have now connected to a database to compute a constant. Considerably more impressive.

### Our Third Program

What if we want to do more than one thing in a transaction? Easy! `ConnectionIO` is a monad, so we can use a `for` comprehension to compose two smaller programs into one larger program.

```scala mdoc:silent
val program3: ConnectionIO[(Int, Double)] =
  for {
    a <- sql"select 42".query[Int].unique
    b <- sql"select random()".query[Double].unique
  } yield (a, b)
```

And behold!

```scala mdoc
program3.transact(xa).unsafeRunSync()
```

The astute among you will note that we don't actually need a monad to do this; an applicative functor is all we need here. So we could also write `program3` as:

```scala mdoc:silent
val program3a = {
  val a: ConnectionIO[Int] = sql"select 42".query[Int].unique
  val b: ConnectionIO[Double] = sql"select random()".query[Double].unique
  (a, b).tupled
}
```

And lo, it was good:

```scala mdoc
program3a.transact(xa).unsafeRunSync()
```

And of course this composition can continue indefinitely.

```scala mdoc
val valuesList = program3a.replicateA(5)
val result = valuesList.transact(xa)
result.unsafeRunSync().foreach(println)
```

### Diving Deeper

All of the **doobie** monads are implemented via `Free` and have no operational semantics; we can only "run" a **doobie** program by transforming `FooIO` (for some carrier type `java.sql.Foo`) to a monad that actually has some meaning.

Out of the box **doobie** provides an interpreter from its free monads to `Kleisli[M, Foo, ?]` given `Async[M]`.

```scala mdoc
import cats.~>
import cats.data.Kleisli
import cats.effect.Blocker
import doobie.free.connection.ConnectionOp
import java.sql.Connection

val interpreter = KleisliInterpreter[IO](Blocker.liftExecutionContext(ExecutionContexts.synchronous)).ConnectionInterpreter
val kleisli = program1.foldMap(interpreter)
val io3 = IO(null: java.sql.Connection) >>= kleisli.run
io3.unsafeRunSync() // sneaky; program1 never looks at the connection
```

So the interpreter above is used to transform a `ConnectionIO[A]` program into a `Kleisli[IO, Connection, A]`. Then we construct an `IO[Connection]` (returning `null`) and bind it through the `Kleisli`, yielding our `IO[Int]`. This of course only works because `program1` is a pure value that does not look at the connection.

The `Transactor` that we defined at the beginning of this chapter is basically a utility that allows us to do the same as above using `program1.transact(xa)`.

There is a bit more going on when calling `transact` (we add commit/rollback handling and ensure that the connection is closed in all cases) but fundamentally it's just a natural transformation and a bind.

#### Using Your Own Target Monad

As mentioned earlier, you can use any monad `M[_]` given `cats.effect.Async[M]`. For example, here we use [Monix](https://monix.io/) `Task`.
```
import monix.eval.Task

val mxa = Transactor.fromDriverManager[Task](
  "org.postgresql.Driver", "jdbc:postgresql:world", "postgres", ""
)

sql"select 42".query[Int].unique.transact(mxa)
```
